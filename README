This is an experimental project to create gradients and other
artful images using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

jsart-interactive.html
---
This is a 400x400 example where you can play around with
equations. Since it uses the eval() method it is much slower
than a hardcoded value but can be used for experimentation.

jsart-000.html
---
The bottom left corner is purple and fades diagonally to green
in the top right corner.

jsart-001.html
---
The top fades vertically straight down from black to gray.

jsart-002.html
---
The top fades vertically downward from black to blue but is striped
with red.

jsart-003.html
---
The same pattern as 002 except the stripes are horizontal.

jsart-004.html
---
This is essentially a plaid pattern. Horizontal stripes of green and
purple and burgundy with vertical stripes of light blue.

jsart-005.html
---
This pattern is hard to explain but is rectangularly gridded with a
left to right gradient in each cell with a diagonal transparent
overlay in reddish pink. Fairly resource intensive. See 007 for the
HTML5 version.

jsart-006.html
---
This is an exact copy of 000 except in HTML5 using the canvas element.

In addition, the cell width is 1 pixel and it's 800x800. Once you do
this you see that the full repeating image is actually a rectangle.

jsart-007.html
---
This is an exact copy of 005 which renders horribly in the old hacky
div method which could result in HTML pages of 14mb at only resolutions
of say 400x400 pixels or there abouts.

So this new version is high resolution at 800x800 and renders in a snap.

jsart-008.html
---
This is by far one of the coolest images I've created yet. It is a series
of diagonal strips that are grayscale gradients of itself in various colors.
Blue, then green, then red, then orange and then it repeats.

jsart-009.html
---
This is a tealish green, blue/purple set of horizontal stripes that seems
pixelish. Basically not antialiased. Does crazy things to the eyes though.

jsart-010.html
---
This one is very similar to 008 except the angle is not 45 degree stripes.
They're more like 30-35 degrees and the blueish and orange stripes that
are side by side are about twice as thick as the neon pink and green stripes.

jsart-011.html
---
This image is primarily a magenta, dark blue and purple with black and a dash
of yellow. There are thick striped lines with some wavey marks over a blue to
pinkish gradient. The top of the image has some unique almost 3 dimensional
warped chessboard patterns which the squares are light blue/purple on top
of the dark magenta background. Those one isn't perfectly symmetrical like most.

jsart-012.html
---
This image is somewhat plaid. It has diagonal stripes in both angles. Each squarei
block has a gradient of teal on the left corner, red on the right, black at the top
and white at the bottom. Each rectangular block that is the main center diagonal
has the left corner teal, the top corner teal, the right bottom side is red, the top
left side is black and the bottom and right corners are white. It's a very interesting
pattern.

jsart-013.html
---
This image is based off of x^2 + y^2 which gives us circles. Almost as if a water drop
is dropped into a pool of water. It is perfectly tiled with similar drops in the background.
It's blue and yellow.

jsart-014.html
---
This image is nearly identical in shape to 012 except it's in neon colors with a parabolic
underlying pattern in the background with the top being a transparent overlay.

jsart-015.html
---
This image has parrallel diagonal stripes of transparent yellow graidents. The background
has parrallel lines that intersect at a point. The angle is around 50 degrees, and are
blue to black gradients. Essentially points.

jsart-016.html
---
This one has horizontal stripes that are transparent overlays with the bottom being green
fadding to 0% opacity. The background is vertical stripes of red gradients fading to black.

jsart-017.html
---
This one came out really interesting. It's plaid like with vertical gradients and diagonal
bars that are gradients. The interesting part is that by using cosine the hard lines are
wavy.

jsart-018.html
---
This is a series of new gradient parrellelograms. One interesting aspect is that there is
a single diagonal row where the parrellelograms are twice as thick.

jsart-019.html
---
This image is somewhat fractal like. It's a neon grid with each large cell containing 4
cells that each contain 4 cells and so on.

jsart-020.html
---
This is a large tile with circles. Each tile is a quarter of the circle. Each ripple of
the circle is red and yellow.

jsart-021.html
---
This one is similar to 019 except it almost looks mandelbrot like. It's very neon with
tree like fractals.

jsart-022.html
---
This one is split diagonally with the bottom left a gradient from black to dark maroon
and the top right side angle sectors filled every other one with black and forest green.
The very top has some mysterious red and curvy lines.

jsart-023.html
---
This one has many different angles of stripes that overlay each other in gradients and
form a diamond/triangular plaidish type image.

jsart-024.html
---
This one has very large diagonal stripes of blue, greenish yellow and red.

jsart-025.html
---
This art is interesting. The top left corner starts out with a diagonal stripe of deep indigo,
and all other stripes are gradients of green, but as you go diagonally from top left to bottom
right the stripes become less gradient and more flat.

jsart-026.html
---
This one has diagonal stripes of red to black gradients with ever increasing blue and interesting
water like splashes or sun beams at the left.

jsart-027.html
---
All hell breaks loose on this pyschedelic piece. It is a sunburst from the top left in a dark blue
maroon and all sorts of patterns. Hard to explain.

jsart-028.html
---
This one is just as pyschedelic as 027. Hard to explain. Almost that effect of looking very close
to an old tube tv or crt monitor. Some what parabolic x/y axis'.

jsart-029.html
---
This image uses a derivation of the mandelbrot set which produces an interesting tile. It's transparent
neon cubes on top of a magenta background.

jsart-030.html
---
This one is only black and yellow gradients and is very geometrical but very asymetrical.

jsart-031.html
---
Identical pattern to 030 but in red, green and black with the lines being thick green gradients.

In the b equation g = make_int(r%x/10); if you increase the 10 to say 16 or 32 the green bars
increase in thickness. There is a limit though. Around 512-1024 it becomes the same general
image but the green lines go away and the image turns to black and red gradients and very
static.

jsart-032.html
---
This one is also identical to 030 and 031 by changing the / to * we get each strip containing 16
stripes because we are using r%x*16.

Again, like 031, once you increase the multiplier of the g component you get a black and red image,
but still the same shape.

jsart-033.html
---
A simple image with some organized static gradients. Black, to blue, to green, to teal.

jsart-034.html
---
This is an interesting sunburst like image from the top left corner. Many colors in a dark blue,
magenta, green pallete.

jsart-035.html
---
Horizontal stripes of transparent magenta to green with a back ground of ever increase parabolas.

jsart-036.html
---
This is a beautiful design. It's a serious of neon gradient cubes, but has large parabolas intersecting
the entire image with each side of the line being a different color.

jsart-037.html
---
This one is really cool. A bunch of gradiented parabolas stack on top of each other going south east.

jsart-038.html
---
This image is somewhat boring at 512/512, but if you blow it up to around 1920x1080 you will see a
large brilliant blue ball appearing in the bottom right corner. If you blow it out even further you
will actually begin to see 037.
